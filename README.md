# Automated Measurement of Arrayed Waveguide Gratings

This repository contains the code for **automating a measurement setup** for the characterization of **Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs)**. The script enables automated control of measurement devices, data acquisition, and visualization of results. This project was developed as part of my **bachelor thesis**.

## Features

- Automated control of measurement hardware  
- Data acquisition and storage  
- GUI for easy operation 

## GUI

## Measurement Principle

The system measures the **insertion loss (IL)** of AWGs across different channels and records the spectral characteristics of the components. **Automation** reduces manual effort and increases the reproducibility of results.

### Functionality
1. **Positioning**: Automated fiber positioning using motors
2. **Coupling Check**: Scanning each input and fitting it with a 2D Gaussian correct alignment can be ensured
3. **Measurement**: Capturing spectral data with an optical power meter
4. **Visualization**: Displaying measurement results in graphs
